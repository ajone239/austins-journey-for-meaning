title: Crying in Hmart by Michelle Zauner
date: "2024-03-01"
excerpt: A sad memoir by a great musician
---

This is a memoir about the lead singer for "Japanese Breakfast" and her journey through her mother's cancer journey and ultimate demise.
I can only recommend it to you if you are in great standings with your own mental health.
The book is well written to such a degree that the author's pain resonates with your own: leaving the reader (me) in a paltry mood.
While the writing was good, the matter of the book was often chaffing; the happy or even cathartic moment in the book were so sparse that I found myself reluctant to pick up the book.

If you want to feel like you need to call your mom and cherish your life, read it.
Otherwise

3/5 stars.
