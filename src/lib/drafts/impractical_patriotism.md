(In reference to CH) I have another incisive, macabre-ish question about your country: where are all the frickin criminals? i.e.
I saw plenty of women and children walking alone at night in dark places -- it's so dope that they are safe but I sort of fail to imagine a land without criminals in it.

I think the question I have is dual fold:

How do you make that culture?
How do you fix a culture that is so far away from that?
A huge thing I noticed in Schwiiz is the huge and unanimous civic pride.
The most anarchist Swiss person is more patriotic than the reddest blooded American, but the sterling engine of an economy and society that US is build on stokes if not requires the classism that breeds the criminality you speak of.
So how do we fix it?

That is a long and complex answer but the basic answer is that "we live in a society".
It's considered important to invest in making the community feel safe for everyone.
If criminality rises, then we don't just shrug our shoulders, we try to figure out why it rose.
We will also blame foreigners, don't get me wrong.
Part of being able to walk around at night safely is that almost everyone has somewhere to go home to at night, which is not the case in the states.
Criminality also has a very clear and common cause: desperation combined with an awareness of unjust inequality.
Most people are not bad.
They won't just attack someone.
However, if they are at the end of their existential rope and they have managed to alienate their victim to the degree where they no longer consider them human or worthy of consideration as a moral object, then bad things happen.
It doesn't take much to make people start to fear either.
One or two incidents suffice to scare people into different behavior.
Even a society like Switzerland is at risk of tumbling from its pedestal.
The short answer is: your society has to teach most of its members to behave justly and fairly because it's the right or only thing to do, not because of possible police punishment.
Apparently we're supposed to vote Blue no matter who and that's gonna fix it.

I think it's interesting to hear and American talk about how another nation's populace has more civic pride, but I understand what you mean.
My wife is a fan of Swiss teams in a way that she never was of U.S. ones.
The U.S. claims to be patriotic but then hates the post office, the DEC, ... everything about the government.
They're trained to hate and mistrust the government by a media owned by the same corporations that are eager to continue plundering resources unfettered by government regulation.
So the duality comes from the inherent contradiction engendered by that mechanism.
It's psychically exhausting living like that.
