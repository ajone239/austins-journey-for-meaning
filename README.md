# A little blog

This may turn into a blog site but for now it is the skeleton of one.

What it needs:
- [x] RSS Feed
- [ ] Website design
    + [ ] Home page design
    + [ ] Blog post cards
    + [ ] Blogs posts on the home page
    + [ ] Fun error page
- [ ] Content lol
- [ ] Resume Section
- [ ] github action build
- [ ] hosting in some way

It may ultimately be ported to my [current blog](https://ajone239.github.io).

# Svelte

This was made with Svelte and was heavily influenced by [this post](https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/build-static-sveltekit-markdown-blog) by [Josh Collinsworth](https://joshcollinsworth.com/about-me).
## Developing

Once you've pulled the project and installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
